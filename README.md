**Software Engineer | Agentic AI Systems | Full-Stack**

I’m a software engineer focused on **shipping production-grade agentic AI systems** — from LLM orchestration and RAG pipelines to data-heavy backends and modern frontends.

I care about **reliability, observability, and real users**, not demos.

## 🚀 Featured Project — **MySplit**
### AI-Native Gym Tracking & Coaching App  
👉 **Live App:** https://mysplit-dun.vercel.app/

**MySplit** is a full-stack, AI-native fitness platform that enables users to log workouts via **text, voice, and AI-assisted planning**, with an emphasis on usability and iteration in real environments.

**Highlights**
- Architected an **AI coaching system** using **LangGraph** featuring:
  - Multi-step planning
  - Schema-validated tool execution
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
  - Traceable agent reasoning for reliability
- Deployed and maintained the application across **web and iOS**, owning:
  - Backend APIs and data models
  - Infrastructure and deployment
  - Iteration based on real user feedback
- Designed for **low latency, debuggability, and cost-aware AI usage**

> MySplit reflects how I approach AI systems: structured, observable, and built for real users.
